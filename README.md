# Project Description:
1. Developed an end-to-end large language model (LLM) application leveraging LangChain, 
OpenAI, and Pinecone's vector database for real-time semantic search and question answering. 

2. Implemented a streamlined pipeline to process PDF documents, split them into manageable chunks, 
and generate embeddings using OpenAI's API. Indexed data in Pinecone for efficient 
cosine similarity-based vector search, enabling high-accuracy retrieval of relevant information. 

3. Utilized OpenAI's GPT model to craft context-aware responses, delivering dynamic insights from vectorized documents.

4. The pdf contains 54 pages and is based on BUdget of Govt of India 2023 when Respected Nirmala Sitharaman was Minister of Corporate Affairs of India.

As soon as query is given, retrieve_query function is called which does similarity search.
